	== Why donate? ==
	
	I could give you many reasons, the investment we've made, server maintenances, 
	work carried out, bandwidth, translations... and although I really hope that 
	these investments can pay off (someday :-D) through advertising or other sponsors, 
	this is not the primary reason.
		
	The donations are for us. For having made this project free and having given it to 
	the community. 
	For having made it and having put all our efforts in it. 
	All our work is open-source.	
	
	You are free to use it. Free to earn money. Free to take advantage of it.
	
	But if you really believe that it has been a useful contribution, a donation will be 
	greatly appreciated.
	
	You set the price. We give you STxT for free.
	
# What are we going to do with the donations? Thereâ€™s a long list... First of all, finance 
# this project. We have had many expenses... translations, domains, the time spent on it. 
# Then, a fair reward for us. If this goes anywhere I think it will be well deserved ;-) 
# Finally, for starting other projects, think of new ideas... There is so much to do! 
# So much to be invented! But we need time to do this. And that is also part of what 
# we are asking for.

# Thanks for helping us!!!
