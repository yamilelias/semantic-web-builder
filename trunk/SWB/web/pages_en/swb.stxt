	===What is SWB?===
	
	It is a set of Apache Ant scripts that allow you to build a portal through the use of 
	pages created with STxT. Although we would like for it to be used as a 
	"source of inspiration" for other projects or developments. With this project we 
	have used this very same site, so we are very pleased with the results.
	
# By the way, I had problems choosing the name SWB. 
# These were the candidates: 	
# * Super Web Builder
# * Semantic Web Builder
# * STxT Web Builder
# * Sexy Web Builder

	===What ISNâ€™T SWB?===
	
	SWB is not an editor or a GUI for creating portals, and is not web development 
	environment. There are great programs for this, and it is not our intention to compete 
	with any of them. 
	
	===Why did you do it?===
	
	Actually we made these scripts in one day; just when we began building this website.
	
	We wanted something that was very functional, quick to do, and that would allow us 
	to have static content 
	quickly published. And it turns out that STxT gave us the solution.
	
	We liked it so much that we had to show it. Besides, it is the source code that we have 
	built this website with. Who else can brag about this?
	
	=== What requirements does it have? ===
	
	Well, in order to run it you need a Java virtual machine and Apache Ant available in the path.
	
	The project is created with Eclipse, so that its integration is direct. For the templates 
	we have used Apache Velocity.
